> Well, look what the stork brung (What?)
> Little baby devil with the forked tongue
> And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (Bleh)
> With a forehead that it grew horns from (Look)
> Still a white jerk (It's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
> With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
> Lyrical technician (Yeah), an electrician (Yeah)
> Y'all light work (Haha)
> And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (What?)
> And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (Why?)

> To turn into some girl scouts
> That censorship bureau's out to (Shut me down)
> So when I started this verse
> It did start off lighthearted at first (Hmm)
> But it feels like I'm targeted
> Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
> Look what I pocketed
> Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
> I've been runnin' at full speed
> And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
> I'm the fight y'all get in
> When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
> I step up to that mic, cock it then
> "Oh my God, it's him! Not again!"
